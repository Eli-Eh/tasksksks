a - Virtual Private Network

b - Advantage 1 - Allows access to data that is behind a region lock
Advantage 2 - Defends privacy by sending all packets through a different ip, making the recipient of the packets not know your ip.
Disadvantage 1 - Some websites or apps ban th use of a VPN, restricting access to themselves until you turn it off.
Disadvantage 2 - Slow down connection speeds, as the packets have to travel farther.

also b?? - i -TCP - Responsible for organising data so it can be transmitted between a server and client.
ii - IP
iii - FTP - Transports files from server to client or vise versa.
iv - POP3

c - i - Turns domain names into IP adresses.
ii - Allows network to identify and authorise specific devices.

d - advantage 1 - No reliance on hub unlike in star network. If the hub fails in a star network, the network no longer works.
advantage 2 - Allows more efficient routes for data to take accross a network, as every node is connected to another.
disadvantage - Expensive o maintain, as there are many connections in a full mesh system.

if weight > 2.6 and doorLocked:

b - Local variables use less memory as they are cleared after use. This makes programs run faster as they are not taking up the primary storage of a system.

Local variables allow you to re-use variable names across different functions, reducing the amount of bug fixing required.

a - Never trust a computer you cannot throw out the window

b - If 6v or more is the input voltage, then the output is 0v. If the input voltage is less than 6v, the output is 6v. If you count <6v as 0 and >6v as 1, then the signal is inverted, where 0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0, otherwise known as a NOT gate.
